# 💻 Java Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **Java problem-solving repository**! 👩‍💻  
This is where I consistently solve coding problems from different platforms using **Java** — building my logic, improving my fundamentals, and growing step by step as a problem solver.

Each folder in this repository represents a topic or platform, and inside you'll find Java programs with meaningful names and clean solutions — sometimes even with multiple approaches!

## 📚 Platforms Covered

I solve problems from various platforms to cover a wide range of logic and pattern-building exercises:

- 🧩 **LeetCode** – Core DSA & real-world interview problems
- 🧠 **HackerRank** – Logic building and Java practice
- 📘 **GFG (GeeksForGeeks)** – DSA, patterns, and concept-based questions
- 🔢 **Number Concepts** – Mathematical puzzles & logics
- 🔁 **Recursion** – Classic recursion challenges
- 📐 **Patterns** – Pattern problems using nested loops
- 🔡 **String** – String manipulation and edge cases
- ⚙️ **Bit Manipulation** – Binary logic and efficient operations
- 🔄 **Arrays** – One of the most fundamental DSA building blocks
