Bobby is attending a seminar on coding, which makes learning more interesting. During the seminar session, he was given a task to find the frequency of a character. Help him find the frequency of a character in a given string.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string.

The second line of input consists of the character to find its frequency.

Output format :
The output consists of the frequency of the character.



Refer to the sample input and output for format specifications.

Code constraints :
Characters are case-sensitive.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Sample Data for analysis
a
Output 1 :
Frequency of a = 5
Input 2 :
Hello Learn c Program
o
Output 2 :
Frequency of o = 2
Input 3 :
Lower and Upper Letter to be noted in alphabets
L
Output 3 :
Frequency of L = 2

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String s = sc.nextLine();
char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);
int count=0;
for(int c:s.toCharArray()){
if(c==ch){
count++;
}
}
System.out.print("Frequency of "+String.valueOf(ch)+" = "+count);
}
}
